"[S&P 500 Since 1950 - 7 crashes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v3WOgbWL/)


Hi guys just wanted to put things in perspective for you all since some of you seem to be quite nervous with the recent week of stock movement. 

I've summarised a list all stock market crashes since 1950. There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. 

The stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.

The graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.

The S&P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). 

I noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a 'fear of overvaluation' was only the dotcom crash where the PE's were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.

I'm not saying a crash / correction won't happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. 

By no means am i an economist but I didn't include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.

Edit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.

No because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let's say) you'll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it's more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of > 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There's roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.

Edit: Changed enron scandal to lehman brothers as some pointed out my mistake.

Edit: Further Log Graph explanation (why log is preferred) If the scale has a large range (i.e. 100 to 3000) then log should be used because its important to show the % changes as opposed to the point changes. A 1 point increase in the SP500 now is only 1/3811 = 0.02% whereas a 1 point increase 10 years ago was 1/1000= 0.1%. It's important to look at it in terms of % change because companies grow in terms of % as well. For example you don't quote apple has grown its business by 30 billion this year ( random number), instead you say apple grew its sales by 20% this year. Its so that its comparable.",S&P 500 since 1950 - graph showing all crashes,lujnvo,top,945,4357,2021-02-28 19:15:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/
"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

"A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation.
