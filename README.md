**WSB-Stock-Scalper**
This program searches certain subreddits of reddit in an effort to gather information about a stock's perception.  This program takes two inputs, the name of a stock the user is interested in and a subreddit from which to gather the information.  The program returns a tally of words or phrases that have positive or negative connotations and assigns a score to the stock's desireablity.
